timpula: what solid principles are used in my Elderlink project

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationFiltering to most relevant informationFrom the provided excerpts, here are some examples of how the SOLID principles might be applied in your ElderLink project:

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Frontend Example**: The `NavBar` component in NavBar.jsx is responsible only for rendering and managing the navigation bar. It does not handle unrelated logic like API calls or state management for other parts of the app.
   - **Backend Example**: The `authController.js` file in authController.js (based on its name) likely handles only authentication-related logic, adhering to SRP.

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **Frontend Example**: The chatbot service in chatbot.js is designed to be extendable. For example, you could add new chatbot prompts or features without modifying the existing `systemPrompt` function.
   - **Backend Example**: The modular structure of the backend (e.g., `controllers/`, `services/`, `models/`) allows for adding new features or APIs without altering existing code.

### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **Backend Example**: The use of inheritance in the `arrow::io` namespace (e.g., `OutputStream` and `InputStream` classes in server/python_backend/ai_chatbot_backend/_internal/pyarrow/include/arrow/io/interfaces.h) suggests adherence to LSP. These derived classes can substitute their base class `FileInterface` without breaking functionality.

### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **Backend Example**: The separation of interfaces in the `arrow::io` namespace (e.g., `Readable`, `Writable`, `Seekable`) in interfaces.h ensures that classes implement only the methods they need.

### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - **Frontend Example**: The `axios` library is used in chatbot.js for API calls. By abstracting API calls into a service layer, the components depend on abstractions (the service) rather than concrete implementations (direct `axios` calls).
   - **Backend Example**: The modular structure of the backend (e.g., `services/` and `controllers/`) suggests that higher-level modules (e.g., controllers) depend on abstractions (e.g., services) rather than directly on lower-level modules.

These principles are evident in the modular and organized structure of your project, which promotes maintainability, scalability, and flexibility.

timpula: Can you create a readme.md for this
